Hi, I want to ask a question about form validation. I know that when you want to validate a form, you need the name of a form and 
the name of the form validation method. Using Bootstrap, I have created a form in the contact section. I am confused in where to 
put my form name and name of form validation method in the gist created in the line 6 of my code. There is a form validation in
the gist created in line 7, however, the form and its elements are created differently from how I created my form and the elements.
